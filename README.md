# temporal-line-up
Temporal data integrated Line Up implemented by Vue.js.
## Design Consideration
The major concern of the project is that we hope to embed the temporal
data into LineUp. This will help users to check the history of each candidate and compare
the history candidate with the current ones simultaneously.
The work is initially used in a paper currently being submitted to a visualization meeting by ZJU-VIS group.



## To Be Done
We are still on our way to make it a complete Vue plugin and hope to make the plugin usable. But
right now, the component is extracted from our full project in the paper and may be difficult for you to integrate into your project.
